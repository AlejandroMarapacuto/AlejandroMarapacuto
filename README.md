Hello! I am Manuel Alejandro Marapacuto PÃ©rez, a 32-year-old professional with a solid background as a Higher University Technician in Computer Science. About a decade ago, I obtained this degree, and although I did not directly pursue the field, I have gained valuable work experience in various domains.

My professional journey has been marked by roles focused on customer service and sales, particularly for English-speaking companies. My bilingual proficiency has enabled me to provide exceptional service, both in the telecommunications industry and in aviation.

Recently, I redirected my career back to my original passion: programming. This year, I completed an intensive Full Stack Developer course at the prestigious "Soy Henry" academy, where I acquired skills in key technologies such as React, Redux, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Sequelize, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, along with a deep understanding of efficient collaboration tools like GitHub and Git Flow. I have also worked with technologies such as Cloudinary, Nodemailer, SweetAlert, and JSON Web Token.

I am characterized as a responsible and cheerful individual, with a strong inclination towards teamwork. I consider myself intelligent and eager to learn, always seeking new opportunities to grow and improve both personally and professionally.

I am excited to continue expanding my skills and contribute to challenging projects in the technology world.

Key Skills:
Programming Languages: JavaScript ( will learn more ofc )
Front-end Technologies: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS
Back-end Technologies: Node.js, Express, Sequelize
